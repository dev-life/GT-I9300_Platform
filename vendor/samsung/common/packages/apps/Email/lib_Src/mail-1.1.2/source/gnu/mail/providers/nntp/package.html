<p>
This is a provider for the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), as
detailed in RFC 977.
</p>

<p>
This provider uses the XHDR command introduced in RFC 2980.
</p>

<p>
The provider can store the state of subscribed newsgroups and read articles
on the local host, using the standard newsrc mechanism.
</p>

<p>
The provider includes both a Store and a Transport implementation. Due to
JavaMail limitations, the transport protocol is called "nntp-post". Use the
same connection setting as the store to post articles. The messages to be
sent must be MimeMessages, and they must have a recipient of type
MimeMessage.RecipientType.NEWSGROUPS, of which the address is a NewsAddress.
</p>

<p>
This provider supports the following properties:

newsgroups on Usenet, this option should be used with caution. Otherwise a
small subset of default newsgroups are returned.</td>
