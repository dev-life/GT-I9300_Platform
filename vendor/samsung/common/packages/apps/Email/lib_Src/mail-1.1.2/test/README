This is a test suite for GNU JavaMail and its providers, based on junit
(http://junit.sourceforge.net/).

To use this test suite, you must create the following files in the current
directory:

transport-urls  : transports to connect to
store-urls      : stores to connect to
folder-urls     : existing folders (probed read-only)
non-folder-urls : nonexistent folders that will be created and deleted
test.message    : a test message to send and store

You wil probably also want to edit the Makefile to set your java compiler,
etc.

The just run make.
