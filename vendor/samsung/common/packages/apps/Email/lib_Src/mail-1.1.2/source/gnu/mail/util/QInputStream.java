/**
 * Provides RFC 2047 "B" transfer encoding.
 * See section 4.2:
 * <p>
 * The "Q" encoding is similar to the "Quoted-Printable" content-
 * transfer-encoding defined in RFC 2045.  It is designed to allow text
 * containing mostly ASCII characters to be decipherable on an ASCII
 * terminal without decoding.
 * <ol>
 * <li>Any 8-bit value may be represented by a "=" followed by two
 * hexadecimal digits.  For example, if the character set in use
 * were ISO-8859-1, the "=" character would thus be encoded as
 * "=3D", and a SPACE by "=20". (Upper case should be used for
 * hexadecimal digits "A" through "F".)
 * <li>The 8-bit hexadecimal value 20(e.g., ISO-8859-1 SPACE) may be
 * represented as "_"(underscore, ASCII 95.). (This character may
 * not pass through some internetwork mail gateways, but its use
 * will greatly enhance readability of "Q" encoded data with mail
 * readers that do not support this encoding.)  Note that the "_"
 * always represents hexadecimal 20, even if the SPACE character
 * occupies a different code position in the character set in use.
 * <li>8-bit values which correspond to printable ASCII characters other
 * than "=", "?", and "_"(underscore), MAY be represented as those
 * characters. (But see section 5 for restrictions.)  In
 * particular, SPACE and TAB MUST NOT be represented as themselves
 * within encoded words.
